# Mapping the Creativity Enhancing Interventions Design Space
Introduction: One thing I want to focus on in my phd are Creativity Enhancing Interventions: Stimuli presented to the user with the goal of triggering some cognitive functions within the user that help them be more creative.
The potential design space for this is vast, therefore I will do some critical cut-offs first:

* I want to focus on a software/computer setting
* I want to focus on stimuli that are visual
* I want to focus on stimuli that can be deployed automatically

These constraints still leave a lot of things open. To order my thoughts, I started by defining dimensions, along which the creativity enhancing inspirations could be ordered.

## Dimensions
I based my collection of dimensions was on three base questions: **When?** **How?** and **What?**

### When?
By what trigger? When in the process?

Related Work: Timely examples

Trigger based on:

* time
* fixed events
* some kind of user model:
   * average results
   * explicit user modeling (theory)
   * machine learning

### How?
Intervention Levels:

* Size
* Position
* Color
* Interaction

#### How long?
How long? Related to both when and how.

### What? 

* ThinkLets
* Inspiration vs Fixation
* Collaboration vs Evaluation Apprehension
* Visual vs Logical Thinkers
* Inspiring Images (CeRRI)?



## Evaluation
The next topic in this space is the evaluation of effectiveness of creativity enhancing interventions, which we will look into next time.
