There is a lot that can be said about programming and programming languages\\
and I deeply respect the people who think about these topics as serious
and passionately as I do.

However, I still feel the need to express some of my views on the matter.\\
So... let's talk about programming!

The way I see it, back in the day, we had this single machine.
It had a single CPU core, some memory and a hard drive.
