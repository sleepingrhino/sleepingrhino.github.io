# Introduction to Collaborative Ideation

Today I want to talk about I research area, that recently captured my interest: "Collaborative Ideation". This research field lies mostly in computer science and applies research from sociology, economy and psychology to enhance software driven innovation processes.

To understand, what this means, we can break down the term into his two components: **Collaboration** is defined as

> a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to achieve shared or overlapping objectives.

So in our case: People, working together on "Ideation". So what is meant by this? Let's look at our trusty collaborative web dictionary again:

> Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an idea is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.

So we have people working together on generating, developing and communicating new ideas. So far this is a pretty broad topic, ranging from [generating a text for a birthday card](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/30859746/siangliulue16ideahound-uist.pdf?sequence=1) to [tackling "the world's biggest challenges"](https://openideo.com/). So in Order to get actual research opportunities, we have to limit the scope further.
