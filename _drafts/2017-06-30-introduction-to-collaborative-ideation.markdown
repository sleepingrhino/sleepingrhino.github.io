# Introduction to Collaborative Ideation

Today I want to talk about a research area, that recently captured my interest: "Collaborative Ideation". This research field lies mostly in HCI (human-computer interaction) and applies research from computer science, design, sociology, economy and psychology to enhance software driven innovation processes.

To understand, what this means, we can break down the term into his two components: **Collaboration** is defined as

> a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to achieve shared or overlapping objectives.

[Source:Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration)

So in our case: People, working together on "Ideation". So what is meant by this? Let's look at our trusty collaborative web dictionary again:

> Ideation is the creative process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an idea is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.

[Source:Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_(creative_process))

This leads us to an informal definition of "people working together on generating, developing and communicating new ideas".

Another aspect, not mentioned in the term "Collaborative Ideation" is the context of computer science: The goal of the research is, to establish ways to enhance collaborative ideation **by using software**, which leads to "people working together using software, in order to generate, develop and communicate new ideas".

So far this is a pretty broad topic, ranging from [generating a text for a birthday card](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/30859746/siangliulue16ideahound-uist.pdf?sequence=1) to [tackling "the world's biggest challenges"](https://openideo.com/). In order to get a context that enables to formulate actual research questions, we have to further limit the scope:

### The first limitation: What stages of ideation to look at?
The requirements for the processes of *generating*, *developing* and *communicating* ideas are very different. So we start by limiting ourselves to the process of *generating* new ideas, which means the process of actually getting ideas out of your head and, in our context, into some form of digital data.

### The second limitation: What are "ideas"?
One of the challenges to define "ideation" in a useful way, is that ideas can look vastly different in terms of data, depending on their field. For example, ideas for a new type of car could be in the form of images or 3d models, while ideas for a themesong of a tv-series could be in the form of mp3 files. So our first compromise is to limit our scope to one very general mode of an idea: **text**.

Leaving the computer science context, the most recognized way to gather ideas in a group is the so called **Brainstorming**-Technique. Fortunately, the artifacts provided by brainstorming normaly come in the form of written down notes. So let's look into that:

## A History of Collaborative Ideation: Brainstorming

Brainstorming was originally developed as a method for creative problem-solving by a man called **Alex F. Osborn** in the year **1939** [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming).

Since then, much has happened: People evolved the process, and there are countless variations of it. Furthermore, people have seen the potential of this technique to be implemented in software: The availability of networked computer systems gave rise to the research area of **Electronic brainstorming (EBS)**. In 1991, the University of Minnesota built an "electronic meeting system", where users could enter ideas into a computer terminal, which were then collected and displayed on a screen. During the following years the area of Electronic Brainstorming Systems explored multiple benefits and disadvantages, leading to a big corpus of research. This is the baseline from which collaborative ideation developed.

## Summary
In this article, I tried to gave a very short definition and overview over the scope of the research area of Collaborative Ideation. Using Wikipedia-Definitions I established the basic scope of the field, then limited the scope in order to get to a practical extent of contexts and challenges. I motivated the current research development by describing the aspects of the history of brainstorming, relevant for the future topics.
In the next article, I will look into the current developments of collaborative ideation, how the beforementioned challenges are tackled and what other interesting results recent research has discovered.
